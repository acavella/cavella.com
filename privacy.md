Personally, I have taken a number of steps to try and maintain my own privacy where possible. So I think I would be remiss if I didn’t try and do the same for those who decide they want to come and read the content that I put out on this site.

Plus, it’s actually the law within the EU.

With all of the above in mind, I want to do what I can to maintain the privacy of visitors to this site wherever possible. So what do I do to help ensure your privacy is maintained?

## 2. Newsletter
I maintain a very basic newsletter where I send a monthly roundup of the posts I’ve published that month. If you’re interested, you can find out more here

This Newsletter is managed by Buttondown Email and I disable all tracking. You can review their privacy policy here.

Also, every newsletter issue I send contains an unsubscribe link that actually works. If you click it, you will be unsubscribed and you won’t receive any more newsletters from me.
