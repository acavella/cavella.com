I'm happy to announce the site has been rebuilt using Simple.css version 2.0, which was just released by Kev Quirk two days ago. If you are looking to create a dead simple website, go check out his work at [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org). 

### What's new?
While the original version of this blog was also based on the original version of Simple.css, I had copied it locally and made some pretty messy edits/hacks to achieve what I wanted. I don't claim to be a web developer, so my knowledge of CSS is minimal at best. Although this approach worked, it was definitely not the optimal way to go about things and some portions of the site didn't work exactly as intended.

When Kev announced version 2.0 of Simple.css on Mastodon, I decided to implement the CSS properly. The first step was to link to the CDN hosted minified version of Simple.css directly. This will allow my site to always be updated with the latest changes and optimizations Kev works into Simple.css. All of my customizations have been built using a second locally hosted stylesheet, custom.css. The biggest change to date are in the header and navigation menu.  I've added a logo and created a simple side-by-side logo/nav format.  I also fixed a responsive feature when the screensize shrinks below 750px wide (such as on a mobile phone), the header switches to stacked layout, logo over navigation.

This site is, as always, a work in progress. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
